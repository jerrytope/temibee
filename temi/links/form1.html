	<h1> POEM 1</h1>
	<h3>What do I have to do to get you to notice me?<br>
Change my hair, the way I walk?<br>
My clothes, the way I talk?<br>
We've known each other for some time now.<br>
</h3>
<h3>Yet I'm still invisible to you:<br>
My feelings run deep and how...<br>
I wish you only knew:<br>
</h3>

	<h3> I see your face every time I close my eyes:<br>
To me, you just seem so different from the other girls:<br>
To you, I'm just a friend...<br>
Nothing more nothing less..<br>.</h3>

<h3>I settle for friendship in the end:<br>
Because I don't want to make a mess,<br>
Instead, I'll keep my secret to myself::<br>
And take my pride back off the shelf.<br>
</h3>
<h3>Until one day you finally see,<br>
That you and I were meant to be.<br>
I'll wait for now but not too long..YES<br>
Because sooner or later I'll be gone.<br>
So when will you notice me?<br>
</h3>

<h1> POEM 2</h1>
<div style="color: blue">
<h3>
Everything was simple,<br>
Everything was fine.<br>
I knew I couldn't have you,<br>
And I knew why.<br>
</h3>
<h3>
I tried to move on.<br>
I moved other girls,<br>
But then when we hang out,<br>
I knew I had lied to myself.<br>
</h3>
<h3>You noticed me drifting.<br>
You said,"Please explain,"<br>
But I didn't want to lose you,<br>
So I tried to deal with the pain.<br>
</h3>
<h3>It's hard to be with you.<br>
It gets harder each day.<br>
When I look into your eyes,<br>
I feel my body floating away.<br>
</h3>
<h3>I miss the way it used to be.<br>
You don't feel the change.<br>
You don't know I really love you.<br>
I'm sure to you; it's just a game.<br>
</h3>
<h3>
	As I close my eyes tonight,<br>
I'll pray as I was taught to do.<br>
I'll pray that you realize that<br>
I love you but I can't have you.<br>
</h3>

<div style= "color: white; background-color:red;">
	<h1>POEM 3</h1>
	<h3>Your smile makes me smile,<br>
Your laugh makes me laugh.<br>
Your eyes are enchanting.<br>
You make my thoughts seem daft<br>
</h3>
<h3>Since the day I first laid eyes on you,<br>
My feelings grew and grew.<br>
In that first conversation, my knees clicked and clacked,<br>
And those butterflies flipped and flapped.<br>
</h3>
<h3>And as I spill these simple rhymes,<br>
My mind goes over time and time.<br>
Why didn't you ask me to kiss you<br>
During that lonely of endless romance?<br>
</h3>
<h3>I hope this doesn't seem to creepy.<br>
Please don't think my thoughts have flown too freely.<br>
Just know that what I speak is true<br>
And that I have fallen deeply for you.<br>
</h3>
